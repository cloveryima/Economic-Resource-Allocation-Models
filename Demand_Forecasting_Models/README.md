# Demand Forecasting Models

This folder contains Python scripts and resources for implementing demand forecasting models. These tools are designed to help businesses and organizations predict future demand, optimize inventory, and make data-driven decisions for resource allocation.

## Overview
Demand forecasting is critical for planning production, managing inventory, and ensuring efficient supply chain operations. This folder includes:
- **Time Series Analysis**: Forecast demand using historical data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict demand with regression and neural network models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the performance of forecasting models.

## Contents
- **forecast_demand.py**: Python script implementing demand forecasting using time series analysis and machine learning.
- **Sample Data**: Includes sample datasets for practice.
- **Documentation**: Step-by-step guide to running the script.

## Getting Started
1. Place your demand data in the `data/` folder.
2. Open `forecast_demand.py` and update the file path for your data.
3. Run the script to generate demand forecasts and visualize results.
